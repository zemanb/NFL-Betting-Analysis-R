# NFL-Betting-Analysis

This html file contains the integrated report and R code from a data analysis project focused on the 2013 NFL season and aimed to answer four questions related to players, plays, and games. 

We examined whether the draft order affected Score Against Spread, analyzed how weather influenced offensive play selection, identified the best and worst quarterback of the season, and determined the most profitable betting category. 

We worked with tidyverse, modelr, and gridExtra libraries for data manipulation and visualization. The project involved four tidy datasets: spreads, plays, players, and games. 

By leveraging these datasets and statistical tools, we gained insights into the relationship between draft order and betting outcomes, the impact of weather on offensive strategies, quarterback performance, and profitable betting strategies for the 2013 NFL season.
